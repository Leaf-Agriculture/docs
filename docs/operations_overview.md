## Operations

The main goal of this entity is to present, in a unified way and agnostic from
the source of the files, operations executed in a given field. For all 
operations identified on Leaf, you also will find the standardGeoJson, 
images, and summary as you can find for each file. 

The operations entity will be automatically generated by the Leaf's API, 
considering operations files executed on the same field and type of the 
operation. You can found more information on how to extract 
on [Operations endpoint page](operations_endpoints.md).
