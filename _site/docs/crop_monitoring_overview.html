<h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>Using Leaf’s Crop Monitoring service you will be able to easily implement a satellite
imagery application and compare the field health evolution over time.</p>

<p>:::success You can get historical images with Leaf.</p>

<p>By default, Leaf retrieves images from 30 days prior to the creation of your
field. But you can increase that to as far back in time as you want.
<a href="/docs/crop_monitoring_endpoints#post-fields">Here’s how</a>
:::</p>

<p>&lt;img alt=”Field example” src={useBaseUrl(‘img/fieldovertime.png’)} /&gt;</p>

<p>This API accepts field boundary polygons and returns processed, clipped, and
color-corrected RGB, NDVI, and NDRE images every time there is a new image available.
We also provide information like percent cloud coverage of the field, the data
coverage percentage, and the tile source for each image as well.</p>

<p>Currently, our Crop Monitoring service runs without a relationship between our Field Services, and the User Management Services.
However, we are working to integrate it into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">leafUser</code> hierarchy, and the Fields Service.</p>

<p>See the <a href="crop_monitoring_endpoints.md">Satellite API Reference</a> for more information.</p>

<h2 id="providers">Providers</h2>

<p>Leaf currently offers access to <a href="/docs/sentinel_overview">Sentinel-2</a> and <a href="/docs/planet_overview">PlanetScope</a> images through its API.
Here is a summary comparison between the providers:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th> </th>
      <th style="text-align: center">Sentinel-2</th>
      <th style="text-align: center">PlanetScope</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Spatial resolution</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">10 m - 60 m</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3 m</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Temporal resolution</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">3 - 5 days</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">1 day</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Spectral resolution</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">12 bands</td>
      <td style="text-align: center">4 - 5* bands</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><em>* the number of bands will depend on the asset type requested</em></p>

<p>For all providers, in addition to the images of the isolated bands, the RGB, NDVI, and NDRE composition are available:</p>
