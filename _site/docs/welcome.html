<h3 id="welcome-to-leafs-documentation">Welcome to Leaf’s Documentation!</h3>

<p>Developers use Leaf’s API to access clean, standardized,
and aggregated Farm data from all major food &amp; agriculture brands.</p>

<p>Please see the <a href="/docs/quickstart">Quickstart</a> section to get started with sample farm data &amp; popular use cases.</p>

<p>We have implementation examples in cURL, NodeJS and Python!</p>

<p>Getting Started</p>

<p>Leaf’s API abstracts and standardizes across agricultural data sources so you can focus on building value with farm data.
There are just a few concepts that you need to get started and we provide sample data within new Leaf accounts to help you learn quickly.</p>
