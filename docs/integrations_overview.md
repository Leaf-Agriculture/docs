## About


With Integrations, you can access all the relevant information between the authentication and the processing of your 
resources ingested into Leaf's API. With that, we can have more discretion on what and how many resources are being processed. 

Having this information available forefront will enable you to prepare your application to receive the resources that will be 
processed, and give more clarity between each data provider and its integration. Its reccomended to utlilize this service combined
with our Alerts Events [Alerts API Reference][alerts_endpoints] where the Integrations Service will give you a scope on 
which and how many resources are being processed, Alerts Events will give you a scope on when these resources will be available

See the [Integrations API Reference][integrations_endpoints] on how to
get more information in the Integrations resources service.
