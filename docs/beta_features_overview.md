The beta features contain experimental features that we are working on but can be used by Leaf customers.
The services available in this section may be updated as we release improvements.

Currently, we are working in the following features:

[1]: #machines

## Assets

This product fetches and stores machine data such as serial number, fuel consumption and start/stop time from providers.
 
Currently, we are obtaining data from the following providers:
   * CNHI
   * JohnDeere
   * Stara



[2]: #prescriptions

## Prescriptions

What are prescriptions in agriculture? Prescriptions usually used to apply inputs at variable rates across a field, applying only the amount needed for each area. For example, a prescription could be based on soil sample results or crop monitoring data, and instructs a machine where to best distribute lime, potassium or other products that can improve soil quality or crop health.

Leaf helps organize the data flow for prescriptions. 

Our supported providers are:
* ClimateFieldView
* John Deere
* Raven Slingshot

Note: The prescription should be included as a zip file and should contain a valid shapefile with least **three** file extentions (**shp**, **dbf** and **shx**) with the same naming.


[3]: #layers

## Layers

You can now get layers (e.g. tassel count, stand count, NVDI, and RGB) via Leafâ€™s Senterra integration. Layers are used to display crop monitoring information geospatially on a farm map so that any variance in a crop can be visualized, usually at a field level. 

Our supported providers are:
* [Sentera](https://withleaf.io/en/blog/sentera-integration-with-leaf/).

Note: Please make sure to follow the [integratation steps for Sentera](https://withleaf.io/en/whats-new/sentera-integration-with-leaf/) before getting layers.

[4]: #input

## Input

This feature will fetch, from operation files, varieties of crops harvested/planted and products applied and store this data.
