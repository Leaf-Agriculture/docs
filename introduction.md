**Welcome to Leaf's Documentation!**

Food and Agriculture developers use Leaf's API to access clean, standardized,
and aggregated Farm data from all major sources. Use the
[Quickstart](/docs/quickstart) section to help you start
accessing sample farm data quickly, easily, and securely. We have implementation
examples in cURL, Python and NodeJS!
