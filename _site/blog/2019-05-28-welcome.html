<p>We’re no strangers to love<br />
You know the rules and so do I<br />
A full commitment’s what I’m thinking of<br />
You wouldn’t get this from any other guy</p>

<p>I just wanna tell you how I’m feeling<br />
Gotta make you understand</p>

<!--truncate-->
<p>Never gonna give you up<br />
Never gonna let you down<br />
Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
Never gonna make you cry<br />
Never gonna say goodbye<br />
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p>

<p>We’ve known each other for so long<br />
Your heart’s been aching but you’re too shy to say it<br />
Inside we both know what’s been going on<br />
We know the game and we’re gonna play it</p>

<p>And if you ask me how I’m feeling<br />
Don’t tell me you’re too blind to see</p>

<p>Never gonna give you up<br />
Never gonna let you down<br />
Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
Never gonna make you cry<br />
Never gonna say goodbye<br />
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you<br />
Never gonna give you up<br />
Never gonna let you down<br />
Never gonna run around and desert you<br />
Never gonna make you cry<br />
Never gonna say goodbye<br />
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</p>

<p>(Ooh, give you up)<br />
(Ooh, give you up)<br />
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)<br />
(Ooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give (Give you up)</p>
